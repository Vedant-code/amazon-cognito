# amazon-cognito
This is a sample code to add amazon cognito in next js application

Install dependencies:
```npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values (YOUR_COGNITO_DOMAIN, YOUR_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_USER_POOL_ID, and YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID) with your actual values.

By following these steps, you should have Google and Apple as identity providers configured in your Next.js app using Amazon Cognito. The withAuth HOC can be used to wrap pages that require authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt the code based on your specific project requirements and folder structure. Make sure to refer to the AWS Amplify documentation for more detailed usage and customization options.
